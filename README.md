Torch.IO-Modpack
================

The Repo for the Torch.IO Modpack. A tech modpack with emphasis on survival.

This modpack is currently only available as a set of configs. Why? Because I haven't gotten all the permissions yet, but I hope to do so soon. A few of these mods are in Alpha/Beta, so they may not work as intended. This modpack is currently in Alpha.

You are the first person ever to land on a distant planet, which looks eerily like Earth. So much so, that scientists couldn't believe what they were looking at. You and your team were sent there to colonize the planet using all the tech at your disposal. Sadly, things didn't go as planned, and your ship crashed. You were lucky to survive, not everyone did. Everything is trashed, and you have to find a way to survive. Turns out, this planet isn't so friendly. Will you survive?
